<strong>I.  Introduction</strong>

<h6>Last Updated:09.15.2015</h6>

<p><strong>Student privacy is paramount to the partners.</strong> In order to become an Open eBooks user, a child will need a registration code. First Book will distribute codes to adults (such as a teacher or school librarian) who serve populations of low-income young people. In order to receive codes, those adults must first register with First Book, which will collect some personally identifiable information about them as part of the registration process. (Please see <a href="http://www.firstbook.org/first-book-story/privacy-and-compliance-policies#privacy"/>First Book’s privacy policy</a>). Those adults will then distribute codes to young people. When possible, teachers and other adults serving young people should check with parents to ensure they understand and approve of their child’s participation in the OEI. Children using the app will not need to provide any personally identifiable information, such as an email address. They will simply input the code to unlock access to the Open eBooks collection. While some aggregate data will be kept on the overall OEI, we will not associate any individual reader’s data with their identity</p>
