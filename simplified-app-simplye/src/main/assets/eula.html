	<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of this EULA, you shall promptly delete and remove any and all Software and Content in your possession or under your control unless otherwise specified. Any termination of access to the Software and/or Content will also immediately terminate any and all licenses granted to you hereunder. All disclaimers of warranties and limitation of liability set forth in this EULA shall survive any termination of this EULA.</p>

	<p>D. &nbsp;NYPL will terminate your access to the Software if, under appropriate circumstances and in NYPL&rsquo;s sole discretion, you are determined to be a repeat infringer of a third party&rsquo;s copyright(s).</p>

	<p><strong>XIV. Compliance</strong></p>

	<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;NYPL reserves the right to take steps NYPL believes are reasonably necessary or appropriate to enforce and/or verify compliance with any part of this EULA. You acknowledge and agree that NYPL may preserve any transmittal or communication by you with NYPL or any third party through the Software or otherwise to this end. All users are advised that any library record or other information collected by NYPL as described herein is, pursuant to New York CPLR &sect;4509, subject to disclosure upon subpoena, court order, or as otherwise authorized by applicable law.</p>

	<p><strong> XV. General Terms</strong></p>

	<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; All Disputes Arising From This EULA. This EULA shall be governed, interpreted, and enforced by the laws of the State of New York. Any legal action brought involving the Software, NYPL Content, and/or EULA shall be brought only in the courts of the State of New York, in the County of New York, or in the federal courts located in such state (and county). Both you and NYPL submit to venue and jurisdiction in these courts. In the event that an action or claim arises outside of the exclusive jurisdiction specified herein which names NYPL as a party, NYPL and you specifically agree to initiate, consent to and/or cooperate with any and all efforts to remove the matter to the exclusive jurisdiction named herein, or otherwise take any and all reasonable actions to achieve the objectives of this provision.</p>

	<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Entire Agreement. This EULA constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and NYPL and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and proposals, oral or written.</p>

	<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Severability. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this EULA is unenforceable, said unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this EULA.</p>

	<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent Transactions. NYPL makes no representation and shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever in relation to your use of any Third-Party Services accessed through the Software. Any transaction completed with any Third-Party Services through the Software, and any dispute concerning the terms of service of any of the Third-Party Services, is between you and the relevant third party, and not NYPL.</p>

	<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remedies. Violation of any of the above provisions or restrictions may result in a termination of your ability to access the Software or the Content. NYPL reserves any and all rights or remedies that may be available in the event of your breach of this EULA.</p>

	<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiver. The failure of NYPL to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this EULA shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision, nor shall any course of conduct between NYPL and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of this EULA.</p>
