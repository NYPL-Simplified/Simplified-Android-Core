 * received in an arbitrary order and, in particular, late. The system needs to
 * be able to determine if a status update is important enough to override an
 * existing status update that was received out of order. The numeric priority
 * values are arbitrary, meant only to provide a partial order, and are subject
 * to change. </p>
