    <title>365 Thank Yous</title>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;One recent December, at age 53, John Kralik found his life at a terrible, frightening low: his small law firm was failing; he was struggling through a painful second divorce; he had grown distant from his two older children and was afraid he might lose contact with his young daughter; he was living in a tiny apartment where he froze in the winter and baked in the summer; he was 40 pounds overweight; his girlfriend had just broken up with him; and overall, his dearest life dreams&amp;#8212;including hopes of upholding idealistic legal principles and of becoming a judge&amp;#8212;seemed to have slipped beyond his reach. &lt;p&gt;Then, during a desperate walk in the hills on New Year's Day, John was struck by the belief that his life might become at least tolerable if, instead of focusing on what he didn't have, he could find some way to be grateful for what he had. &lt;p&gt;Inspired by a beautiful, simple note his ex-girlfriend had sent to thank him for his Christmas gift, John imagined that he might find a way to feel grateful by writing thank-you notes. To keep himself going, he set himself a goal&amp;#8212;come what may&amp;#8212;of writing 365 thank-you notes in the coming year.&lt;p&gt;One by one, day after day, he began to handwrite thank yous&amp;#8212;for gifts or kindnesses he'd received from loved ones and coworkers, from past business associates and current foes, from college friends and doctors and store clerks and handymen and neighbors, and anyone, really, absolutely anyone, who'd done him a good turn, however large or small. Immediately after he'd sent his very first notes, significant and surprising benefits began to come John's way&amp;#8212;from financial gain to true friendship, from weight loss to inner peace. While John wrote his notes, the economy collapsed, the bank across the street from his office failed, but thank-you note by thank-you note, John's whole life turned around. &lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;365 Thank Yous&lt;/I&gt; is a rare memoir: its touching, immediately accessible message&amp;#8212;and benefits&amp;#8212;come to readers from the plainspoken storytelling of an ordinary man. Kralik sets a believable, doable example of how to live a miraculously good life. To read &lt;I&gt;365 Thank Yous&lt;/I&gt; is to be changed.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <title>Always Running</title>
    <alternativeHeadline>La Vida Loca: Gang Days in L.A. </alternativeHeadline>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;By age twelve, Luis Rodriguez was a veteran of East L.A. gang warfare. Lured by a seemingly invincible gang culture, he witnessed countless shootings, beatings, and arrests, then watched with increasing fear as that culture claimed friends and family members. Before long, Rodriguez saw a way out of the barrio through education and successfully broke free from years of violence and desperation. Achieving success as an award-winning poet, he was sure the streets would haunt him no more - until his son joined a gang. Rodriguez fought for his child by telling his own story in this vivid memoir. At times heartbreakingly sad and brutal, Always Running is ultimately an uplifting true story, filled with hope, insight, and a hard-learned lesson for the next generation.&#13;

    <title>Amazing Grace</title>
    <alternativeHeadline>Hymns That Changed the World</alternativeHeadline>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;The complete story of how John Newton, a slave ship captain and self-proclaimed "wretch," was inspired to write Amazing Grace. He devotes his life to God and becomes an ordained minister. This program also includes the stories behind these four hymns: 1. It Is Well With My Soul - Horatio Spafford, a man blessed beyond measure, is rocked by a succession of personal tragedies. Sorrow becomes hope as he pens one of the most profound expressions of faith ever recorded. 2. Silent Night - Austrian parish priest Joseph Mohr's poem, the only song he ever wrote, and schoolteacher Franz Gruber's simple and haunting music, capture the beauty and wonder of the birth of Christ in the carol that took on a life of its own. 3. How Great Thou Art - The beauty and power of a thunderstorm inspired Swedish minister Carl Boberg to write a poem that over the years will be translated and transformed into what is perhaps the world's most beloved hymn of worship.  4. What A Friend We Have In Jesus - A poem Joseph Scriven wrote to his ailing mother is set to music and becomes one of the world's greatest hymns, and the legacy of a man who dedicated his life to helping the sick and poor. Extra Feature: Be Thou My Vision: In soaring music and breathtaking images, this program is a uniquely inspiring experience where the timeless acts of reverence and devotion to God come alive with all the excitement, promise and splendor of a new dawn.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

Of the four, Jack was Bob's very best friend, a bond forged from the moment they met on the first day of kindergarten. They grew up together, got in trouble together, learned about life together -- and were ultimately separated by time and distance, as all adults are. But through the years Bob and Jack stayed close, holding on to the friendship that had formed years before.&lt;p&gt;Then, the fateful call came: Jack was dying. And in this hour of need, as the closest of all friends will do, Bob, Allen, Chuck, and Dan put aside the demands of their own lives, came together, and saw Jack through to the end of his journey.&lt;p&gt;Tremendously moving, funny, heart-stirring, and honest, &lt;i&gt;And You Know You Should Be Glad&lt;/i&gt; is an uplifting exploration of the power of friendship to uphold us, sustain us, and ultimately set us free.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    </author>
    <summary>&lt;P&gt;In this seamless diary narrative, best-selling author Barbara Kingsolver tells how she and her family relocated to southern Appalachia after suffering through years of drought in Arizona. Their purpose was to "live in a place that could feed us" by growing their own food and living among a community of local organic food growers.&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Animal, Vegetable, Miracle&lt;/I&gt; follows the family through the first year of their experiment to realign their lives with the local food chain. They find themselves eager to move away from the typical food scenario of American families: a refrigerator packed with processed, factory-farmed foods transported long distances using nonrenewable fuels. In their search for another way to eat and live, they begin to recover what Kingsolver considers our nation's lost appreciation for the American family farm.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <title>Ballad Of The Whiskey Robber</title>
    <alternativeHeadline>A True Story of Bank Heists, Ice Hockey, Transylvanian Pelt Smuggling, Moonlighting Detectives, and Broken Hearts</alternativeHeadline>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;P&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, meet Attila Ambrus, the Robin Hood of eastern Europe. He's the onetime pelt smugger, goaltender (possibly the worst in the history of professional hockey), pen salesman, Zamboni driver, gravedigger, church painter, roulette addict, building superintendent, whiskey drinker, and native of Transylvania who's decided that the best thing to do with his time is to rob as many banks as possible. &lt;P&gt;His rival: Lajos Varju, the Inspector Clouseau of the Iron Curtain, whose knowledge of police work comes from Hungarian-dubbed episodes of Colombo. His deputy is nicknamed "Mound of Asshead" because of his propensity for crashing police cars. His forensics expert, known as "Dance Instructor" for his lucrative side career teaching ballet, wears a top hat and tails on the job. &lt;P&gt;Welcome to Julian Rubinstein's uproariously funny and unforgettable account of crime in the heart of the new Europe. With a cast of backup characters that includes car wash owners, exotic dancers, drunk army generals, cocaine-snorting Hungarian rappers, the Johnnie Cochran of Budapest, and a hockey team that seems to spend as much time breaking the law as they do practicing, Ballad of the Whiskey Robber gives us the most charming outlaw-hero since the Sundance Kid, and the Sundance Kid didn't play hockey. &lt;P&gt;As the Eastern bloc slips off its communist skin and replaces it with leopard-skin hot pants, Ballad of the Whiskey Robber is here to screw in the pink lightbulbs. Part Unbearable Lightness of Being, part Pink Panther, and part Slap Shot, Julian Rubinstein's tale is a spectacular literary debut, and a story so outrageous that it could only be true.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <title>Beckett Remembering/Remembering Beckett</title>
    <alternativeHeadline>A Centenary Celebration</alternativeHeadline>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;This revealing collection offers fresh insights into one of the 20th century's greatest, most enigmatic writers. In life, Samuel Beckett was one of the most private of men, preferring to let his writing speak for itself. In this commemorative volume, through interviews with his official biographer, he speaks of his youth, his home and family, his schools in Dublin, his life in Paris as an exchange student from Trinity College Dublin, his early writings, and his war years in the south of France. The second part of the work includes dozens of pieces written about him by those who knew him best, worked with him most closely, or admired him for his enduring influence, among them Edward Albee, Paul Auster, J. M. Coetzee, Hume Cronyn, Eug&#232;ne Ionesco, Anthony Minghella, Tom Stoppard, and Jessica Tandy. Of special interest are remembrances of Beckett as a young man from fellow students at Trinity College Dublin and from L'Ecole Normale Sup&#233;rieure in Paris. For those familiar with Beckett's work, this will enhance their knowledge; for those who are not, it is a revealing introduction to the Nobel Prize-winning author's life and work.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <summary>For those who have been there, there is no forgetting the sounds and smells of summer camp: of dusty playing fields, platform tents, and wood cabins; of mist rising off the water at dawn and the sparks of a Sunday night campfire sailing up into a cold night sky. Now Michael D. Eisner shares a deeply personal memoir of his own experiences at one remarkable Vermont summer camp, of the life lessons he learned there and how they helped turned him into the man he is today.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <title>Charlie Chaplin: The Forgotten Years</title>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;When Charles Chaplin was forced to leave the USA in 1952, he found harbor in Switzerland and settled in a small village on Lake Geneva where he lived with his family until the end of his life in 1977.  In his autobiography, written from his new home, he calls these the happiest years.  In this film, the audience is invited to gain rare insight into his family-life and his love for the circus.  Chaplin&#8217;s children Geraldine, Michael and Eugene talk about their father and many friends, colleagues and contemporaries share their very intimate memories as well as highly entertaining anecdotes with the viewer.  This documentary focuses for the first time on his later films and projects and gives evidence of Chaplin&#8217;s prolific years as a musical composer of 500 pieces of music.  In this homage, Chaplin&#8217;s life will be illustrated by newly found unique footage from private archives.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <title>The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin</title>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Franklin's celebrated Autobiography, published after his death, is one of the greatest autobiographies of all time&#8230; but it was incomplete. Franklin ended his life's story in 1757, when he was only fifty-one. He lived another thirty-three full, eventful, and dramatic years, some of the most dramatic years in American history, years in which Franklin was America's advocate in London, represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, and was America's wartime ambassador to France. During these years Franklin also helped write our nation's Constitution and planned an American Empire that would displace the British Empire.&lt;p&gt;Franklin is one of the most fascinating of the Founding Fathers&#8212;a polymath like Jefferson, a practical statesman like Washington, and a cynic and wit beyond parallel. Now, at last, in &lt;i&gt;The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin&lt;/i&gt;, we finally get the rest of the story, in Franklin's own words.&lt;p&gt;Faithfully compiled and edited from Franklin's papers by Dr. Mark Skousen&#8212; Franklin's descendant, acting as his devoted secretary&#8212;this is the closest we will ever get to Franklin sitting down in his study in Philadelphia, dipping quill into ink, and finishing his autobiography.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;A candid and moving memoir from the critically acclaimed singer and songwriter&lt;p&gt;For thirty years as a musician, Rosanne Cash has enjoyed both critical and commercial success, releasing a series of albums that are as notable for their lyrical intelligence as for their musical excellence.&lt;p&gt;Now, in her memoir, Cash writes compellingly about her upbringing in Southern California as the child of country legend Johnny Cash, and of her relationships with her mother and her famous stepmother, June Carter Cash. In her account of her development as an artist she shares memories of a hilarious stint as a twenty-year-old working for Columbia Records in London, recording her own first album on a German label, working her way to success, her marriage to Rodney Crowell, a union that made them Nashville's premier couple, her relationship with the country music establishment, taking a new direction in her music and leaving Nashville to move to New York. As well as motherhood, dealing with the deaths of her parents, in part through music, the process of songwriting, and the fulfillment she has found with her current husband and musical collaborator, John Leventhal.&lt;p&gt;Cash has written an unconventional and compelling memoir that, in the tradition of M. F. K. Fisher's The Gastronomical Me and Frank Conroy's Stop-Time, is a series of linked pieces that combine to form a luminous and brilliant whole.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <title>Conversations with David Foster Wallace</title>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Across two decades of intense creativity, David Foster Wallace (1962-2008) crafted a remarkable body of work that ranged from unclassifiable essays, to a book about transfinite mathematics, to vertiginous fictions. Whether through essay volumes (&lt;i&gt;A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, Consider the Lobster&lt;/i&gt;), short story collections (&lt;i&gt;Girl with Curious Hair, Brief Interviews with Hideous Men, Oblivion&lt;/i&gt;), or his novels (&lt;i&gt;Infinite Jest, The Broom of the System&lt;/i&gt;), the luminous qualities of Wallace's work recalibrated our measures of modern literary achievement. &lt;i&gt;Conversations with David Foster Wallace&lt;/i&gt; gathers twenty-two interviews and profiles that trace the arc of Wallace's career, shedding light on his omnivorous talent.Jonathan Franzen has argued that, for Wallace, an interview provided a formal enclosure in which the writer "could safely draw on his enormous native store of kindness and wisdom and expertise." Wallace's interviews create a wormhole in which an author's private theorizing about art spill into the public record. Wallace's best interviews are vital extra-literary documents, in which we catch him thinking aloud about his signature concerns&amp;#8212;irony's magnetic hold on contemporary language, the pale last days of postmodernism, the delicate exchange that exists between reader and writer. At the same time, his acute focus moves across MFA programs, his negotiations with religious belief, the role of footnotes in his writing, and his multifaceted conception of his work's architecture. &lt;i&gt;Conversations with David Foster Wallace&lt;/i&gt; includes a previously unpublished interview from 2005, and a version of Larry McCaffery's influential &lt;i&gt;Review of Contemporary Fiction&lt;/i&gt; interview with Wallace that has been expanded with new material drawn from the original raw transcript.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <title>Conversations with Steve Martin</title>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conversations with Steve Martin&lt;/i&gt; presents a collection of interviews and profiles that focus on Martin as a writer, artist, and original thinker over the course of more than four decades in show business. While those less familiar with his full body of work may think of Martin as primarily the "wild and crazy guy" with an arrow through his head, this book makes the case that he is in fact one of our nation's most accomplished and varied artists. It shows the full range of Martin's creative work, tracing the source of his comic imagination from his early standup days, starting in the mid to late 1960s through the films he has written and starred in, and emphasizing his more recent creative outpourings as playwright, essayist, novelist, memoirist, songwriter, composer, musician, and art critic.&lt;p&gt;"Standup is the hardest material in the world to write for someone else; it's like trying to condense 10 years of experience into 20 minutes of new material.," Martin says. But commenting on his fiction writing, he says. "I think you have to be able to find as a writer that state where you don't know what you're going to say or what the character is going to say or who the characters are. That's the biggest thrill of all. When you start to trust that subconscious thing and you don't censor yourself&amp;#8212;just remember you can always throw it away&amp;#8212;that's when the good stuff comes out."&lt;p&gt;The selected materials consist not only of pieces focused primarily on Martin's writings, but also broader profiles and conversations that help explain Martin's development as a writer within the larger context of his many other accomplishments, talents, and performance skills.&#13;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;2007 Audie&#174; Award Finalist - Biography/Memoir&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this gripping, candid, and remarkably powerful memoir, Anderson Cooper offers an unstinting, up-close view of the most harrowing crises of our time, and the profound impact they have had on his life. &lt;p&gt;After growing up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Cooper felt a magnetic pull toward the unknown. If he could keep moving, and keep exploring, he felt he could stay one step ahead of his past, including the fame surrounding his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, and the deaths of his father and older brother. As a reporter, the frenetic pace of filing dispatches from war-torn countries, and the danger that came with it, helped him avoid having to look too closely at the pain and loss that was right in front of him. &lt;p&gt;But recently, during the course of one extraordinary, tumultuous year, it became impossible for him to continue to separate his work from his life. From the tsunami in Sri Lanka to the war in Iraq, the starvation in Niger, and ultimately Hurricane Katrina, Cooper gives us a firsthand glimpse of the devastation that takes place when the normal order is ruptured on such a massive scale. Cooper had been in his share of life-threatening situations before -- in Sarejevo, Somalia, and Rwanda -- but he had never seen human misery quite like this. Writing with vivid memories of his childhood and early career as a roving correspondent, Cooper reveals how deeply affected he has been by the wars, disasters, and tragedies he has witnessed, and why he continues to be drawn to some of the most perilous places on earth.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;When Mark Doty went looking to adopt a small dog-- a cuddly creature who might comfort his terminally ill partner, Wally Roberts--he was surprised to find himself returning home from an animal shelter with a full-grown golden retriever, a dog whose &#8220;absolute openess of regard&#8221; and paw gently offered through the bars of a cage proved irresistable to him. Beau, as the retriever was called, was so malnourished and in need of care that he was initially mistaken for a different breed, and Doty soon found himself attending to the constant needs of a dog starved for attention and a man confined to his bed. But the new member of the household --which also included Arden, Doty&#8217;s black retriever--managed to provide a measure of comfort to everyone; as Wally nears death, Beau rushes headlong into his new life.&lt;p&gt;DOG YEARS is the story of Doty&#8217;s life with Arden and Beau, two retrievers who would, each in his own way, leave a profound mark on him: Arden, who likes sleeping outdoors, even in the rain, who is observant and contemplative, who is friendly and eager to please; Beau, blithe, snatching the glove from his master&#8217;s hand and running away with it, a mischievous gleam in his eye, always full of daring and bounding toward his next source of amusement. As his time with the dogs reaches its end, Doty must face the difficult realization that to deal with death is to accept it as the utter loss of an irreplaceable value: to grieve is to understand that, while we may carry on, while we may find new loved ones, the loss we have experience is the disappearance of a unique individual who will never return --and this tragic disruption will become a permanent part of us.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Sharon Osbourne has lived-in her own words-"fifty lives in fifty years."  As the daughter of notorious rock manager Don Arden, Sharon's childhood was a chaotic mix of glamour and violence, one week touring with Little Richard and Jayne Mansfield, the next meeting the Animals and Electric Light Orchestra. In her late twenties, after years of fierce loyalty to her ruthless father who had betrayed her many times, Sharon finally made the painful decision to break with her family.  Sharon found her soul mate in rock star Ozzy Osbourne, turning his career around and becoming a legendary manager and rock promoter in her own right.  But Ozzy's drug-and drink-fuelled excesses-which culminated in an attempt to strangle her-made their marriage a white-knuckle ride from the start; only her devotion to their three children gave her the will to survive.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of December 7, 1941, as a stunned nation gathered around the radio to hear the latest about Pearl Harbor, Eleanor Roosevelt was preparing for her weekly Sunday evening national radio program. At 6:45pm, listeners to the NBC Blue network heard the First Lady's calm, measured voice explain that the president was conferring with his top advisors to address the crisis. It was a remarkable broadcast. With America on the verge of war, the nation heard first not from their president, but from his wife.&lt;BR&gt;Eleanor Roosevelt's groundbreaking career as a professional radio broadcaster is almost entirely forgotten. As First Lady, she hosted a series of prime time programs that revolutionized how Americans related to their chief executive and his family. Now, &lt;I&gt;The First Lady of Radio&lt;/I&gt; rescues these broadcasts from the archives, presenting a carefully curated sampling of transcripts of Roosevelt's most famous and influential radio shows, edited and set into context by award-winning author and radio producer Stephen Drury Smith. With a foreword by Roosevelt's famed biographer, historian Blanche Wiesen Cook, &lt;I&gt;The First Lady of Radio&lt;/I&gt; is both a historical treasure and a fascinating window onto the power and the influence of a pioneering First Lady.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <summary>In 1989, Robert B. Oxnam, the successful China scholar and president of the Asia Society, faced up to what he thought was his biggest personal challenge: alcoholism. But this dependency masked a problem far more serious: Multiple Personality Disorder.  At the peak of his professional career, after having led the Asia Society for nearly a decade, Oxnam was haunted by periodic blackouts and episodic rages. After his family and friends intervened, Oxnam received help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffery Smith, and entered a rehab center. It wasn&#8217;t until 1990 during a session with Dr. Smith that the first of Oxnam&#8217;s eleven alternate personalities &#8211; an angry young boy named Tommy &#8211; suddenly emerged. With Dr. Smith&#8217;s help, Oxnam began the exhausting and fascinating process of uncovering his many personalities and the childhood trauma that caused his condition.

    <summary>When Cokie and Steve Roberts got married, some "friends" said it wouldn't last because she's Catholic and he's Jewish. In this book, Cokie and Steve discuss issues of their own marriage as well as tell tales of famous unions in history, like that of John and Abigail Adams, as seen from their different perspectives as man and wife. Conversations with contemporary couples show the foundation of marriage as one that's undergone tremendous amounts of change while remaining fundamentally the same.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;At 77, Bergman no longer works in film, the medium that brought him world fame; he gave it up in 1983, when he announced that Fanny and Alexander would be his last film. This ingenious little collection is Oliver's attempt to say something meaningful about Bergman the masterful artist of many mediums&amp;#8212;film, theater, television, print&amp;#8212;the Renaissance artist. To accomplish the goal, Oliver selected essays that address Bergman's work as a film director (by such noted directors as Woody Allen, Franc{&#8225;}ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard); with actors in film and on stage (by such as Liv Ullmann, Max von Sydow, Bibi Andersson); as it relates to his intellect (by such as James Baldwin, Caryn James, John Lahr).&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    </author>
    <summary>In January 1928, the surrealists initiated their remarkable &amp;amp;ldquo;researches into sexuality&amp;amp;rdquo; with a series of round-table conversations involving key figures such as Andr&amp;#233; Breton, Yves Tanguy, Louis Aragon, Man Ray, Max Ernst and Antonin Artaud. The transcripts, in all their bizarre and fascinating detail, are presented here. While there is plenty of humor--not all of it intentional--the speakers were trying scrupulously to record every aspect of sexual love, cataloging preferences and positions, quality and quantity. This book is a unique historical record of sexual practice and ethics; a fundamental text for understanding the surrealist movement and, for all its idiosyncrasies, a document that still retains an extraordinary vitality today.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <summary>Janice Dickinson was not only the first of the supermodels&#8212;it was she who (literally) invented the term.  A raven-haired natural beauty, she endured a nightmarishly traumatic childhood at the hands of a sadistic, sexually and emotionally abusive father, and emerged in the early 1970s as the first lush-lipped, &#8220;exotic&#8221; brunette to break into a modeling world dominated by sunny California blondes. 
 But this is more than Janice&#8217;s tale of triumph. Janice also tells us what&#8217;s real about beauty and what&#8217;s not, and how women don&#8217;t have to be slaves to the pictures they see on the glossy pages of Vogue.  She discusses why we need to feel perfect, and how our pasts, our unattainable ideas of beauty, and male expectations all collude to make women feel like they should be working towards the next major makeover before next year&#8217;s model steps up to the bed.  
 Funny, gutsy, gossipy, yet ultimately searching and unforgettable, Janice Dickinson&#8217;s story is an amazing story of hard won success unlike any you&#8217;ve heard before.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover quality: 1.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Judy Garland on Judy Garland&lt;/I&gt; is the closest we will come to experiencing and exploring the legend's planned autobiography. Collecting and presenting the most important Garland interviews and encounters that took place between 1935 and 1969, this work opens with her first radio appearance under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and concludes with her last known interview, one taped for Radio Denmark just months before her death. What makes this collection unique is that it places Judy in the role of storyteller. She wrote a number of essays for various publications and sat for countless print, radio, and television interviews. These and other autobiographical efforts she made are proof that Judy Garland wanted her story told in her own words. Finally, 45 years after her death, here it is.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work quality: 0.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary quality: 0.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;License Source: Overdrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <alternativeHeadline>Mickey Mantle and the End of America's Childhood</alternativeHeadline>
    <author>
      <name></name>
    </author>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Jane Leavy, the acclaimed author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy&lt;/i&gt;, returns with a biography of an American original&amp;#8212;number 7, Mickey Mantle. Drawing on more than five hundred interviews with friends and family, teammates, and opponents, she delivers the definitive account of Mantle's life, mining the mythology of The Mick for the true story of a luminous and illustrious talent with an achingly damaged soul.&lt;p&gt;Meticulously reported and elegantly written, &lt;i&gt;The Last Boy&lt;/i&gt; is a baseball tapestry that weaves together episodes from the author's weekend with The Mick in Atlantic City, where she interviewed her hero in 1983, after he was banned from baseball, with reminiscences from friends and family of the boy from Commerce, Oklahoma, who would lead the Yankees to seven world championships, be voted the American League's Most Valuable Player three times, win the Triple Crown in 1956, and duel teammate Roger Maris for Babe Ruth's home run crown in the summer of 1961&amp;#8212;the same boy who would never grow up.&lt;p&gt;As she did so memorably in her biography of Sandy Koufax, Jane Leavy transcends the hyperbole of hero worship to reveal the man behind the coast-to-coast smile, who grappled with a wrenching childhood, crippling injuries, and a genetic predisposition to alcoholism. In &lt;i&gt;The Last Boy&lt;/i&gt; she chronicles her search to find out more about the person he was and, given what she discovers, to explain his mystifying hold on a generation of baseball fans, who were seduced by that lopsided, gap-toothed grin. It is an uncommon biography, with literary overtones: not only a portrait of an icon, but an investigation of memory itself. How long was the Tape Measure Home Run? Did Mantle swing the same way right-handed and left-handed? What really happened to his knee in the 1951 World Series? What happened to the red-haired, freckle-faced boy known back home as Mickey Charles?&lt;p&gt;"I believe in memory, not memorabilia," Leavy writes in her preface. But in &lt;i&gt;The Last Boy&lt;/i&gt;, she discovers that what we remember of our heroes&amp;#8212;and even what they remember of themselves&amp;#8212;is only where the story begins.&#13;

Also included is an essay by UCLA history professor Brenda Stevenson that contextualizes these narratives, as well as a look into the daily life of a slave.
