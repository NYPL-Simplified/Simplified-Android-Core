&lt;p&gt;His Toughest Mission Yet &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navy SEAL Mason Brown left Conifer, Alaska, and his broken marriage behind long ago. Until one call changed everything. His ex-wife has died in a tragic accident, and given custody of her twin baby girls to Mason and her sister Hattie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hattie Beaumont always dreamed of having a family--and Mason--but never like this. Now those old longings seem like betrayal, especially since playing house with Mason comes naturally. She can tell he feels it, too, so why is he determined to leave? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mason knows Hattie and the girls are the greatest Christmas gift he'll ever get. But even though he's risked his life countless times, risking his heart again feels so much more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

They want to experiment on anyone left over from Prime Destinations--Starters who can be controlled and manipulated. With the body bank destroyed, Callie no longer has to rent herself out to creepy Enders. But Enders can still get inside her mind and make her do things she doesn't want to do. Like hurt someone she loves. Having the chip removed could save her life--but it could also silence the voice in her head that might belong to her father. Callie has flashes of her ex-renter Helena's memories, too . . . and the Old Man is back, filling her with fear. Who is real and who is masquerading in a teen body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is ever who they appear to be, not even the Old Man. Determined to find out who he really is and grasping at the hope of a normal life for herself and her younger brother, Callie is ready to fight for the truth.

For many, sex has become a low priority as they navigate marriage, motherhood, and work . . . not to mention chronic stress and lack of sleep. Throw in the natural fluctuations in hormone levels that all women experience--whether due to PMS or pregnancy or while postpartum or perimenopausal, and beyond--and it is not surprising that sex becomes, well, a little less sexy. Common gynecological problems can make sex uncomfortable, and medical issues can cause it to be downright painful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've been unwilling or afraid to talk to your doctor about...</summary>

He also reflects on the lessons he&#8217;s learned from baseball, Playboy bunnies, Las Vegas, and his attempts to become chaplain to the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, all while (somehow) crafting essays about the spiritual importance of generosity, sacrifice, openness, and spiritual transformation. Really.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Essays include:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#183; WWJD: What Would Jesus Drink?&lt;br /&gt;&#183; Brewed Over Me and Distill Me, O Lord&lt;br /&gt;&#183; Pearls of Great Price&lt;br /&gt;&#183; Chicken Soup for the Hooters Girl&#8217;s Soul&lt;br /&gt;&#183; Miss Hawaii and Other Miss Takes&lt;br /&gt;&#183; Don&#8217;t Leave me Hanging: The Theological Significance of Athletic Supporters &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the deeply touching to the laugh-out-loud funny, these stories ultimately open our minds to the glory of God and our mouths to some of God&#8217;s more delicious creations. &lt;i&gt;The Beer Drinker&#8217;s Guide to God&lt;/i&gt; is a smart, hilarious book for those thirsty for God&#8217;s truth.</summary>

In "Personal Journey," the author discusses the open, inquisitive, and good-humored qualities of the "heart of the Buddha," an "enlightened gene" that everyone possesses. In "Stages on the Path," he presents the three vehicles&amp;#8212;Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana&amp;#8212;that carry the Buddhist practitioner toward enlightenment. In "Working with Others," he describes the direct application of Buddhist teachings to topics as varied as relationships, drinking, children, and money. The Heart of the Buddha reflects Trungpa's great appreciation for Western culture and deep understanding of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, which enabled him to teach Westerners in an effective, contemporary way.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you rather your child be smart or good? Many families and almost all schools spend the majority of time developing children academically. While useful, academic achievement is not the only important aspect of raising a child. Educator Michael Parker maintains that noncognitive skills are just as important to a child's success, and that the main way children learn these skills is from their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk with Your Kids prompts thoughtful and effective discussion between parents and children by posing 109 open-ended questions.

All his life, Nels has wanted to be a knight of the kingdom of Av&#235;rand. Tall and strong, and with a knack for helping those in need, the people of his sleepy little village have even taken to calling him the Knight of Cobblestown. But that was before Nels died, murdered outside his home by a mysterious figure. Now the young hero has awoken as a ghost, invisible to all around him save one person&amp;#8212;his only hope for understanding what happened to him&amp;#8212;the kingdom's heir, Princess Tyra. At first the spoiled royal wants nothing to do with Nels, but as the mystery of his death unravels, the two find themselves linked by a secret, and an enemy who could be hiding behind any face. Nels and Tyra have no choice but to abscond from the castle, charting a hidden world of tangled magic and forlorn phantoms. They must seek out an ancient needle with the power to mend what has been torn, and they have to move fast. Because soon Nels will disappear forever.</summary>

Living in the city, Maya is too far from her friend Keysha and her boyfriend, Misalo--and too near her rebellious cousin Viviana. When Maya finally comes home, her parents drop a bombshell--Viviana is moving in with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her cousin has barely unpacked before she's creating chaos. Truth is, Maya kind of likes the way life is a whole lot less predictable with Viviana around. But her motives are up for debate--especially when it comes to Misalo. And as Maya's little sister, Anna, grows more fascinated with her cool older cousin, Maya begins to see that following where Viviana leads has its price. And it could cost Maya her reputation, her relationship...and maybe even her future....</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael turned fourteen in May. By June, both his parents are dead, victims of a car crash. And for Michael, who has lived all his life in a small Newfoundland outport community, this means being suddenly uprooted and sent to live with relatives in St. Albert, a city hundreds of miles away. Hold Fast is the story of Michael's struggle to survive in his new environment. In vivid, honest prose, it depicts his fight against those who stand as threats to his pride in himself and his way of life &amp;#8212; the loud-mouthed Kentson who makes fun of the way he talks at school, and his uncle who tries to rule life at home with an iron hand. It is also the story of the friendship that develops between Michael and Curtis, his cousin, and of his new uncertain feelings for Brenda. Hold Fast has received many awards, and a panel of experts from across Canada named it the country's second-best children's book of all time (second only to Anne of Green Gables).</summary>

Was she abducted, or did she run for her life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul "The Bomb" Baum tells the truth. No matter what. It was something he learned at Sunday school. But telling the truth can cause problems, and not just minor ones. And as Paulie discovers, &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; the truth can be even more problematic. Period 8 is supposed to be that one period in high school where the truth can shine, a safe haven. Only what Paulie and Hannah (his ex-girlfriend, unfortunately) and his other classmates don't know is that the ultimate liar is in their midst. Terrifying, thought-provoking, and original, this novel combines all the qualities of a great psychological thriller with the controversy, ethics, athletics, humor, and raw emotion of a classic Crutcher...</summary>

When the SEALs send their elite, they send SEAL Team Six--a secret unit made up of the finest soldiers in the country, if not the world. This is the dramatic tale of how Howard Wasdin overcame a tough childhood to live his dream and enter the exciting and dangerous world of Navy SEALS and Special Forces snipers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His training began with his selection for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S)--the toughest and longest military training in the world. After graduating, Wasdin saw combat in Operation Desert Storm as a member of SEAL Team Two. But he was driven to be the best of the best--he wanted to join the legendary SEAL Team Six, and at long last he reached his goal and became one of the best snipers on the planet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon he was fighting for his life in Africa, hunting the Somalian warlord Aidid. But the mission fell apart when his small band of soldiers found themselves cut off from help and desperately trying to rescue downed comrades during a routine mission. The Battle of Mogadishu, as it become known, left 18 American soldiers dead and 73 wounded.&lt;br /&gt;This is Howard Wasdin's story of overcoming numerous obstacles to become an elite American warrior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;i&gt;B95 can feel it: a stirring in his bones and feathers. It's time. Today is the day he will once again cast himself into the air, spiral upward into the clouds, and bank into the wind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wears a black band on his lower right leg and an orange flag on his upper left, bearing the laser inscription B95. Scientists call him the Moonbird because, in the course of his astoundingly long lifetime, this gritty, four-ounce marathoner has flown the distance to the moon--and halfway back! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B95 is a robin-sized shorebird, a red knot of the subspecies &lt;i&gt;rufa. &lt;/i&gt;Each February he joins a flock that lifts off from Tierra del Fuego, headed for breeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic, nine thousand miles away.  Late in the summer, he begins the return journey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B95 can fly for days without eating or sleeping, but eventually he must descend to refuel and rest. However, recent changes at ancient refueling stations along his migratory circuit--changes caused mostly by human activity--have reduced the food available and made it harder for the birds to reach. And so, since 1995, when B95 was first captured and banded, the worldwide &lt;i&gt;rufa &lt;/i&gt;population has collapsed by nearly 80 percent. Most perish somewhere along the great hemispheric circuit, but the Moonbird wings on. He has been seen as recently as November 2011, which makes him nearly twenty years old. Shaking their heads, scientists ask themselves: How can this one bird make it year after year when so many others fall?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;National Book Award-winning author Phillip Hoose takes us around the hemisphere with the world's most celebrated shorebird, showing the obstacles &lt;i&gt;rufa&lt;/i&gt; red knots face, introducing a worldwide team of scientists and conservationists trying to save them, and offering insights about what we can do to help shorebirds before it's too late. With inspiring prose, thorough research, and stirring images, Hoose explores the tragedy of extinction through the triumph of a single bird.  &lt;i&gt;Moonbird &lt;/i&gt;is one &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;'s Best Kids Books of 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary>

    <title>Rapture Practice</title>
    <author>
      <name>Aaron Hartzler</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;i&gt;Sometimes salvation is found in the strangest places: a true story.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Aaron Hartzler grew up in a home where he was taught that at any moment the Rapture could happen. That Jesus might come down in the twinkling of an eye and scoop Aaron and his family up to heaven. As a kid, Aaron was thrilled by the idea that every moment of every day might be his last one on planet Earth.&lt;br /&gt;But as Aaron turns sixteen, he finds himself more attached to his earthly life and curious about all the things his family forsakes for the Lord. He begins to realize he doesn't want the Rapture to happen just yet--not before he sees his first movie, stars in the school play, or has his first kiss. Eventually Aaron makes the plunge from conflicted do-gooder to full-fledged teen rebel.&lt;br /&gt;Whether he's sneaking out, making out, or playing hymns with a hangover, Aaron learns a few lessons that can't be found in the Bible. He discovers that the best friends aren't always the ones your mom and dad approve of, and the tricky part about believing is that no one can do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;In this funny and heartfelt coming-of-age memoir, debut author Aaron Hartzler recalls his teenage journey to find the person he is without losing the family that loves him. It's a story about losing your faith and finding your place and your own truth--which is always stranger than fiction.</summary>

      <name>Marc Aronson</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A fascinating and timely biography of J. Edgar Hoover from a Sibert Medalist. "King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. . . . You better take it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self is bared to the nation." Dr. Martin Luther King received this demand in an anonymous letter in 1964. He believed that the letter was telling him to commit suicide. Who wrote this anonymous letter? The FBI. And the man behind it all was J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI's first director. In this unsparing exploration of one of the most powerful Americans of the twentieth century, accomplished historian Marc Aronson unmasks the man behind the Bureau- his tangled family history and personal relationships; his own need for secrecy, deceit, and control; and the broad trends in American society that shaped his world. Hoover may have given America the security it wanted, but the secrets he knew gave him- and the Bureau - all the power he wanted. Using photographs, cartoons...</summary>

So begins this honest and powerful account of a family's journey to the fields of California &amp;#8212; to a life of constant moving, from strawberry fields to cotton fields, from tent cities to one-room shacks, from picking grapes to topping carrots and thinning lettuce. Seen through the eyes of a boy who longs for an education and the right to call one palce home, this is a story of survival, faith, and hope. It is a journey that will open readers' hearts and minds.</summary>

    <title>The Freedom Summer Murders</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Summer murders, this will be the first book for young adults to explore the harrowing true story of three civil rights workers slain by the KKK.&lt;p&gt;In June of 1964, three idealistic young men (one black and two white) were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi. They were trying to register African Americans to vote as part of the Freedom Summer effort to bring democracy to the South. Their disappearance and murder caused a national uproar and was one of the most significant incidents of the Civil Rights Movement, and contributed to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;p&gt;THE FREEDOM SUMMER MURDERS will be the first book for young people to take a comprehensive look at the brutal murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, through to the conviction in 2005 of mastermind Edgar Ray Killen.</summary>

    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;These frank and harrowing true stories of young Iraqi refugees show surprising resilience, as the children try to survive the consequences of a war in which they played no part.&lt;p&gt;In this book, Deborah Ellis turns her attention to the most tragic victims of the Iraq war &amp;#8212; Iraqi children. She interviews young people, mostly refugees living in Jordan, but also a few who are trying to build new lives in North America. Some families have left Iraq with money; others are penniless and ill or disabled. Most of the children have parents who are working illegally or not at all, and the fear of deportation is a constant threat. Ellis provides an historical overview and brief explanations of context, but other than that allows the children to speak for themselves, with minimal editorial comment or interference. Their stories are frank, harrowing and sometimes show surprising resilience, as the children try to survive the consequences of a war in which they played no part...</summary>

    <title>The Betrayal of Africa</title>
    <author>
      <name>Gerald Caplan</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Think Africa, and many people think of brutal war, endless famine, pervasive corruption, unworthy rulers, universal poverty, an AIDS epidemic out of control. As this book in the Groundwork Guides series shows, these characteristics are both true and a caricature at the same time. With the bold new presence of China in Africa, with an active and angry civil society demanding more from their governments, and with a new generation of leaders apparently committed to doing better in the future, a real possibility for positive change now exists. But for Africa to move forward, the citizens of rich countries must be aware of the false premises on which their own leaders deal with the continent. While Africa faces a daunting list of challenges, the vast majority of the continent's citizens live ordinary lives with the hopes and dreams that all of us share.</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;b&gt;A memoir of the Civil Rights Movement from one of its youngest heroes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the youngest marcher in the 1965 voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Albama, Lynda Blackmon Lowery proved that young adults can be heroes. Jailed eleven times before her fifteenth birthday, Lowery fought alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. for the rights of African-Americans. In this memoir, she shows today's young readers what it means to fight nonviolently (even when the police are using violence, as in the Bloody Sunday protest) and how it felt to be part of changing American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straightforward and inspiring, this beautifully illustrated memoir brings readers into the middle of the Civil Rights Movement, complementing Common Core classroom learning and bringing history alive for young readers.</summary>

Janeczko probes such stories as that of Elizabeth Van Lew, an aristocrat whose hatred of slavery drove her to be one of the most successful spies in the Civil War; the "Choctaw code talkers," Native Americans who were instrumental in sending secret messages during World War I; the staggering engineering behind a Cold War tunnel into East Berlin to tap Soviet phones (only to be compromised by a Soviet mole); and many more famous and less-known examples.

Yet without it, life as we live it today would be impossible. Oil fuels our engines, heats our homes, and powers the machines that make the everyday things we take for granted, from shopping bags to computers to medical equipment. Nations throughout the last century have gone to war over it.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, oil influences every aspect of modern life.

Zia Dontella is determined to show the kids how a home-cooked meal is better than even the best take-out pizza or burrito. And when Zia's plan actually transports Alfie and Emilia to famous food cities around the world, they learn first-hand how food can not only take you places but can also bring you back home. Alfie and Emilia find themselves transported to Naples, where they meet Marco, a young Italian boy on a very important mission to shop for the essential ingredients for his family's entry in the city's annual pizzafest contest. In their whirlwind search for the perfect items, Alfie and Emilia not only get a taste of Italy, but also find themselves refereeing a family feud between Marco's family and his uncle's family.</summary>

Why are television shows like Sesame Street good at teaching kids how to read?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In THE TIPPING POINT, New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell, looks at why major changes in society happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point.&lt;p&gt; Gladwell uncovers the personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious.THE TIPPING POINT is an intellectual adventure story with an infectious enthusiasm for the power...</summary>
