  "summary": "Before Liz Lemon, before \"Weekend Update,\" before \"Sarah Palin,\" Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.<br /><br />She has seen both these dreams come true.<br /><br />At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon -- from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.<br /><br />Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.<br /><br />(<i>Includes Special, Never-Before-Solicited Opinions on Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!)</i><br /><br />",
